# Decision Log

**Append-only.** Never edit or delete a past entry — if a decision changes, add a new entry that supersedes it and say so explicitly ("supersedes entry [D-xx]").

This file exists so that across API-credit-limited handoffs between APC AI instances and zero-memory local agent sessions, a settled question is **never re-litigated from scratch** because nobody could find the earlier reasoning. When in doubt about whether something belongs here: if re-deriving it would cost more than one paragraph of reasoning, it belongs here.

**Format for each entry:**
- **[D-xx]** Decision title
- **Date / Session:** When it was locked
- **Decision:** What was locked or selected
- **Reasoning:** Why this choice was made over alternatives
- **Affects:** Components, interfaces, or tasks impacted

**Reserved Decision IDs:** Decision IDs are reserved per task by the APC AI in the task prompt, not invented on the fly by local agents. This prevents ID collisions during concurrent worktree tasks.

**[D-01]** Architecture baseline and repository governance locked.  
- **Date / Session:** Inception  
- **Decision:** Adopted APC (Analyzer, Planner, Controller) + Local Agent orchestration model with strict repository-as-source-of-truth governance.  
- **Reasoning:** Decouples high-level strategic reasoning and cross-session memory from filesystem-level implementation and execution, preventing hallucinated drifts and lost context across credit resets.  
- **Affects:** All documents, tasks, and development workflows.

**[D-02]** [Template Entry — Reserved for Core Architectural Decision]  
- **Date / Session:** [Date]  
- **Decision:** [e.g., Selected Framework / Database / Representation]  
- **Reasoning:** [Why this was selected over alternatives]  
- **Affects:** [Components impacted]
